# Comparing-classification-algorithms
In this work we want to run different classification algorithms and do hyperparameters tuning with applying on the Parkinson cancer dataset we got form UCI. The goal is given a patient, we want to determine whether the patient has a cancer or not. Also, we want to compare the accuracy of these algorithms on the given dataset.
